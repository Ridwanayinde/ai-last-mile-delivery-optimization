# 🎓 MIT Emerging Talent Graduation Project

## Overview

This domain study is developed independently as part of my MIT Emerging Talent graduation project. It consolidates all foundational work I have done so far — including background review, brainstorming sessions (divergent and convergent), key terms, and the problem statement — providing a structured understanding of the Nigerian logistics ecosystem.

🧠✨ This is a personal research space that reflects my own exploration, analysis, and progressive refinement of the logistics sector.

## Purpose of This Domain Study 🎯

The purpose of this domain study is to:

- Document my **current understanding** of Nigeria’s logistics landscape.

- Capture my **iterative thinking process**, from background knowledge to  brainstorming to problem refinement.

- Provide a **structured reference** for subsequent technical work (data collection, modelling, or solution design).

## What This Domain Study Includes 📦

Below are the main components I have developed so far:

1. **Background Review 📚**  
   A comprehensive overview of the Nigerian logistics industry, including economic relevance, market characteristics, and sector behaviour.

2. **Brainstorming Sessions 💡**  
   - **Divergent brainstorming:** Expanding possible ideas, identifying challenges, forces, constraints, and opportunities.  
   - **Convergent brainstorming:** Narrowing down focus areas, grouping insights, and refining the core logistics issues.

3. **Problem Statement 🚨**  
   A clear articulation of the systemic inefficiencies and bottlenecks limiting Nigeria’s logistics performance.

4. **Key Terms & Concepts 📝**
   Standardised definitions of all logistics-related terminology used throughout the study, ensuring clarity and consistent interpretation.

5. **Market & Sector Mapping 🗺️**
   - Stakeholder maps, value chains, sub-sector breakdowns, and structure of the Nigerian logistics ecosystem (to be expanded).

6. **Data Sources & References 🔗**
   - A list of verified external sources used during the research.

## How to Use This README 🧭

This README serves as the guide for anyone exploring or contributing to the domain study. Since this is a solo project, all work reflects my own research and decisions. Use this file to:

- Navigate the domain study components

- Understand the rationale behind each section

- Stay aligned with the overall logistics project direction

This README will continue to evolve as I add:

- Sector analysis documents

- Visual diagrams (stakeholder maps, value chains, etc.)

- Data dictionaries

- Methodology notes
