# Background Review

## Logistics and Last-Mile Delivery in Nigeria

1. **Introduction**

   Logistics involves the planning, implementation, and control of the efficient flow
   and storage of goods, services, and information from origin to consumption. Shipping
   refers to the movement of goods, while logistics encompasses the broader system,
   including warehousing, sorting, and distribution.

   **Last-mile delivery** is the final stage of the supply chain, moving goods from a warehouse
   or distribution hub to the end consumer. Globally, this phase accounts for **40–55% of**
   **total logistics costs**, and it is particularly complex due to urban congestion, customer
   expectations, and operational inefficiencies.

   Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) form the backbone of Nigeria’s economy,
   contributing over 48% of GDP and employing ~84% of the workforce (SMEDAN/NBS). For SMEs in
   sectors like e-commerce, retail, and manufacturing, reliable last-mile delivery
   is critical. Inefficiencies increase costs, reduce customer satisfaction, and limit
   scalability.

2. **Global Perspective**

Emerging markets such as India, Brazil, Indonesia, and parts of Africa face similar logistics challenges:

- Rapid urbanization and growing e-commerce demand

- Informal delivery networks

- Infrastructure gaps, poor road networks, and traffic congestion

- High fuel and labor costs

- Technology and innovation trends globally include:

- AI-driven route optimization and real-time tracking (reducing delivery times by 20–30%)

- Micro-fulfillment centers and crowd-sourced delivery platforms for same-day delivery

- Drones and electric vehicles for sustainable last-mile solutions (Zipline, Amazon drones, DHL IoT fleets)

These innovations highlight potential efficiency gains and cost reductions, especially in high-density urban areas.
However, adoption among SMEs in emerging markets remains limited due to cost, skills, and infrastructure gaps.

3.**Nigeria-Specific Context**

Nigeria’s freight and logistics market is valued at **USD 10–15 billion in 2025**, growing at a
Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 6–9% due to e-commerce and urbanization (Mordor Intelligence).

Key factors shaping logistics:

- **Infrastructure**: Only ~30% of roads are paved; potholes, flooding, and collapsing highways are common.
  Rail and air freight remain underdeveloped.

- **Regulatory environment**: Overlapping mandates among federal, state, and local agencies create checkpoints,
  delays, and extortion. Truckers on major routes can lose ₦50,000–200,000 per trip.

- **Stakeholders**: Mix of informal operators (motorcycles, tricycles), organized logistics companies
  (GIG Logistics, DHL, Kobo360), and e-commerce giants (Jumia, Konga).

- **Market dynamics**: Last-mile delivery is estimated at USD 200–500 million, growing with e-commerce
  penetration (20–25% annual increase in delivery volumes).

As a result, Nigeria’s logistics costs are **2–3 times higher than global averages**, contributing to
higher consumer prices and inflationary pressures.

4.**Last-Mile Delivery Focus**

The last-mile stage accounts for **50–70% of total logistics costs** in Nigeria. Key challenges include:

- Bottlenecks: Non-standardized addressing, urban traffic, poor rural roads, security risks

- Operational challenges: High fuel and maintenance costs, route deviations due to checkpoint extortion,
  delivery failures (20–30% return rates), rider shortages

- Impact on SMEs: High logistics costs (20–40% of revenue), cart abandonment (>50%), limited ability to
  offer same-day delivery

- This stage is where upstream inefficiencies converge, disproportionately affecting small businesses
  and limiting their competitiveness.

5.**Technology / Data Insights**

Global and local case studies indicate potential improvements:

- Platforms like Gojek, Dunzo, and Zipline reduce delivery times and extend reach to remote areas.

- Nigerian pilots: Kobo360 (trucking), Gokada/Konga Logistics (urban delivery), AI route optimization,
  EV initiatives

- Barriers to SME adoption: low tech uptake (~10–20%), high data costs, unreliable power, connectivity
  gaps, and informal sector resistance

While innovations exist, broader rollout for SMEs requires supportive infrastructure, training, and affordable tools.

6.**Gaps and Research Justification**

Key gaps in the literature include:

- Limited empirical data quantifying the impact of regulatory inconsistencies on route deviations and delivery costs

- Low adoption of digital tools among informal last-mile operators

- Lack of standardized addressing systems and scalable digital solutions tailored to Nigeria’s hybrid
  formal-informal ecosystem

- Understudied effects on SME competitiveness in intra-African trade (AfCFTA era)

- Implication: Addressing these gaps would improve operational efficiency, reduce costs,
  SME competitiveness, and unlock Nigeria’s e-commerce potential.
