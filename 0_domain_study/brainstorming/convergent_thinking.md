## Identifying the Critical Bottleneck in Nigeria’s Logistics System

After examining Nigeria’s logistics ecosystem through a broad, divergent lens—including
infrastructure conditions, regulatory dynamics, multimodal transport performance, warehousing
challenges, port inefficiencies, security risks, and the role of both formal and informal
actors—it becomes clear that these diverse pressures do not operate in isolation. Instead,
they converge at a single, recurring pain point within the supply chain: the last-mile stage,
where goods move from distribution hubs to final consumers. This stage consistently emerges as
the most strained, most unpredictable, and most operationally expensive segment across Nigeria’s
logistics system.

Many of the upstream inefficiencies highlighted earlier accumulate their impacts at this final link.
Port delays ripple outward into city congestion; poor road networks translate into slower urban and
peri-urban mobility; regulatory inconsistencies cause route deviations; and infrastructural strain
in major economic hubs increases the burden on delivery actors operating at the neighborhood level.
In this sense, last-mile delivery becomes the “pressure point” where systemic constraints become
visible to both businesses and consumers.

Small businesses feel these pressures most acutely. Unlike larger firms with dedicated logistics
departments, private fleets, warehousing capacity, or bargaining power with transport providers,
small enterprises operate with minimal buffers. They commonly depend on fragmented informal
transport networks—such as ad-hoc motorbike riders or small courier services—that themselves
operate without standardized processes. This exposes small businesses to unpredictable
delivery times, inconsistent reliability, higher per-unit transport costs, and limited
visibility into customer fulfillment. As a result, last-mile inefficiencies directly influence
their sales volumes, customer satisfaction, and operational budgets.

Several characteristics of Nigeria’s urban environment intensify these challenges. High population density,
complex traffic patterns, and non-standardized addressing systems create an environment where even
short-distance deliveries can be delayed or mis-routed. Seasonal flooding, inconsistent road quality,
and security concerns further complicate delivery reliability. Because small businesses often serve
customers in both formal and informal settlements, they face the broadest spectrum of these constraints.

Across the divergent research, last-mile delivery repeatedly emerges as the space where national
logistics bottlenecks are most concentrated and where small businesses experience the greatest friction.
It is the point in the system where inefficiencies shift from being background structural issues to becoming
immediate operational problems that affect daily sales, customer relationships, and business viability.
The convergence of systemic challenges, localized environmental factors, and the specific limitations
faced by small enterprises makes this stage a critical area for deeper examination.

For these reasons, last-mile logistics for small businesses becomes the most coherent focal point for the
next stage of the project. Narrowing the scope here allows for a more precise investigation into the practical
constraints, behavioral patterns, and operational realities that shape business outcomes in emerging markets
like Nigeria. This convergence sets the foundation for exploring targeted interventions in later sections,
once the core problem has been fully articulated.
