# Problem Statement for Nigeria’s Logistics Sector

Despite Nigeria’s position as one of Africa’s largest economies and a major West African
trade hub, the logistics and supply chain sector continues to face deep structural, operational,
and infrastructural challenges that limit its efficiency, competitiveness, and ability to
support national economic growth. Logistics costs in Nigeria remain among the highest in
sub-Saharan Africa, driven by unreliable transport infrastructure, port congestion,
fragmented regulations, low supply-chain visibility, and limited adoption of modern
logistics technology.

These inefficiencies increase the cost of doing business, reduce the competitiveness of
Nigerian manufacturers and exporters, and hinder the smooth movement of goods across both
domestic and international supply chains. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which
rely heavily on logistics providers, are disproportionately affected, facing delays, high
freight rates, limited warehousing options, and inconsistent last-mile delivery services.

Addressing these challenges is critical to unlocking Nigeria’s full economic potential,
improving trade facilitation, reducing operational bottlenecks, and enabling logistics
companies to meet the growing demands of e-commerce, agriculture, manufacturing, and
regional trade.
