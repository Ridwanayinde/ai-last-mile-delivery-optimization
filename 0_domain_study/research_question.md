## Research Questions 📋

This file outlines the research questions guiding my MIT Emerging Talent graduation project
on the Nigerian logistics sector. All questions reflect my independent research and aim to
provide a structured framework for the domain study.

1. Main Research Question 🎯
   How can the logistics sector in Nigeria be optimized to reduce costs, improve efficiency,
   and support SMEs and large-scale trade effectively?

2. Sub-questions / Specific Questions 💡
     1. What are the key bottlenecks and inefficiencies in Nigeria’s current logistics and
        supply chain ecosystem?

     2. How do infrastructure challenges (roads, ports, warehousing) affect logistics performance?

     3. What are the regulatory, operational, and technological barriers limiting the growth of logistics companies?

     4. How are SMEs and large enterprises impacted differently by logistics inefficiencies?

     5. What are the opportunities for technology, data, and innovative solutions to improve logistics performance?

     6. How do different logistics sub-sectors (freight, last-mile delivery, warehousing, cold chain) compare in terms
        of challenges and performance?

3. Research Scope Notes 🗺️
